# Azure to AWS Migration Guide

General migration tips for moving workloads from Azure to **Amazon ECS** and **AWS Step Functions**.

## Service Mapping

| Azure | AWS | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Azure Container Instances (ACI) | ECS Fargate | Serverless containers, no cluster management |
| Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) | ECS (EC2 or Fargate) or EKS | ECS is simpler; EKS if you need full Kubernetes |
| Azure App Service (containers) | ECS + ALB | App Service is PaaS; ECS gives more control |
| Azure Logic Apps | Step Functions | Visual/orchestrated workflows |
| Azure Durable Functions | Step Functions + Lambda | Stateful orchestration patterns |
| Azure Service Bus | SQS / SNS / EventBridge | Queue vs pub/sub vs event routing |
| Azure Key Vault | AWS Secrets Manager / SSM Parameter Store | Store secrets outside task definitions |
| Azure SQL Database / PostgreSQL / MySQL | Amazon RDS | Managed relational DB; engine-for-engine mapping |
| Azure AD / Microsoft Entra ID | Amazon Cognito User Pools (+ optional federation) | Workforce SSO; can federate Entra instead of replacing |
| Azure AD B2C | Amazon Cognito User Pools | Customer-facing sign-up/sign-in and social IdPs |
| Azure Monitor / App Insights | CloudWatch + X-Ray | Logs, metrics, traces |

## ECS Migration Tips

### 1. Container image registry

- Move images from **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** to **Amazon ECR**.
- Re-tag and push: `docker tag <acr-image> <account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<repo>:<tag>`
- Use `aws ecr get-login-password` for authentication.
- Scan images in ECR and enable lifecycle policies to prune old tags.

### 2. Task definition vs Azure container config

Azure ACI uses a single JSON/YAML spec. ECS splits concerns:

- **Task definition** — CPU, memory, container image, env vars, secrets, logging
- **Service** — desired count, deployment strategy, load balancer attachment
- **Cluster** — logical grouping (Fargate clusters are lightweight)

Map ACI `resources.requests/limits` to ECS `cpu` and `memory` (Fargate has fixed combinations).

### 3. Networking

| Azure | AWS |
|-------|-----|
| Virtual Network (VNet) | VPC |
| Subnet | Subnet (public/private) |
| NSG | Security Group |
| Application Gateway | ALB / NLB |
| Private Endpoint | VPC endpoints (for ECR, S3, Secrets Manager) |

- Run ECS tasks in **private subnets**; place ALB in public subnets.
- Use **awsvpc** network mode (required for Fargate).
- Assign security groups at the task ENI level, not just the service.

### 4. Secrets and configuration

- Do **not** bake secrets into task definitions or environment variables in source control.
- Use **Secrets Manager** or **SSM Parameter Store** with `secrets` in the container definition.
- Map Azure App Configuration / Key Vault references to SSM paths or Secrets Manager ARNs.
- Use IAM task roles (not access keys) for AWS API access from containers.

### 5. Logging and monitoring

- Replace Azure Monitor / Log Analytics with **CloudWatch Logs**.
- Set `logConfiguration` in the task definition (`awslogs` driver).
- Create CloudWatch alarms on CPU, memory, and ALB target health.
- Enable **Container Insights** on the ECS cluster for deeper metrics.

### 6. Deployment strategy

- Azure Container Apps / App Service use slot swaps; ECS uses **rolling deployments** via services.
- Use **deployment circuit breaker** with rollback on failed deployments.
- For blue/green, use CodeDeploy or two services behind weighted ALB rules.
- Pin task definition revisions; avoid `:latest` image tags in production.

### 7. Autoscaling

- Azure scale rules → **ECS Service Auto Scaling** (target tracking on CPU/memory or custom CloudWatch metrics).
- For queue-driven workloads, scale on **SQS ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible**.
- Set `minCapacity` / `maxCapacity` and cooldown periods to avoid thrashing.

### 8. Common pitfalls

- Wrong CPU/memory combo for Fargate (must match [supported pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-cpu-memory-error.html)).
- Missing IAM permissions for ECR pull (`ecr:GetAuthorizationToken`, `ecr:BatchGetImage`).
- Tasks in private subnets without NAT Gateway or VPC endpoints (cannot reach ECR/CloudWatch).
- Health check path/port mismatch between container and ALB target group.

## Step Functions Migration Tips

### 1. Workflow mapping

| Azure | Step Functions |
|-------|----------------|
| Logic Apps (sequential) | Standard workflow, sequential states |
| Logic Apps (parallel branches) | `Parallel` state |
| Durable Functions (orchestrator) | Standard workflow with `Task` + `Choice` |
| Retry policies | `Retry` and `Catch` on individual states |
| Timers / delays | `Wait` state |

### 2. Choose workflow type

- **Standard** — long-running, exactly-once, up to 1 year. Best for orchestration migrated from Durable Functions.
- **Express** — high-volume, short-lived (< 5 min), at-least-once. Best for high-throughput event fan-out.

### 3. Replace Azure connectors

Logic App connectors map to Step Functions **Task** states invoking AWS services:

| Logic App connector | AWS equivalent |
|--------------------|----------------|
| HTTP / REST | Lambda, or `arn:aws:states:::http:invoke` (callback pattern) |
| Service Bus | SQS `SendMessage` / `ReceiveMessage` |
| Blob Storage | S3 `GetObject` / `PutObject` |
| SQL / Cosmos DB | Lambda proxy, or SDK integration where available |
| Send email | SES via Lambda or direct integration |

Prefer **AWS SDK service integrations** (`arn:aws:states:::sqs:sendMessage`) over Lambda wrappers when possible — fewer moving parts, built-in retries.

### 4. How Lambda params load

When a **Task** state invokes Lambda, Step Functions builds the payload **before** `Invoke` runs:

1. **`InputPath`** (optional) — slices the current state input (default: `$`, the whole object).
2. **`Parameters`** — maps that slice into the Lambda `Payload` using JSONPath and intrinsic functions.
3. **Lambda handler** — receives the payload as the `event` argument (Node: `exports.handler = async (event) => …`).

Example state:

```json
"ProcessOrder": {
  "Type": "Task",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:states:::lambda:invoke",
  "Parameters": {
    "FunctionName": "process-order",
    "Payload": {
      "orderId.$": "$.order.id",
      "customer.$": "$.customer"
    }
  },
  "ResultSelector": {
    "status.$": "$.Payload.status"
  },
  "ResultPath": "$.result",
  "Next": "Done"
}
```

With execution input `{ "order": { "id": "123" }, "customer": "alice" }`, Lambda's `event` is:

```json
{ "orderId": "123", "customer": "alice" }
```

After the task, **`ResultPath`** merges the Lambda response into state at `$.result` (here, only `status` via `ResultSelector`).

- Keys ending in `.$` pull values from the input; static keys pass literals.
- Without `Parameters.Payload`, the filtered input is sent as-is.
- **`OutputPath`** (default `$`) controls what the *next* state receives.

### 5. State machine design

- Keep states **small and idempotent** — Step Functions will retry on transient failures.
- Use **Choice** states instead of deeply nested conditionals.
- Pass data with `InputPath`, `OutputPath`, `ResultPath`, and `Parameters` — avoid huge payloads (256 KB state limit).
- Store large blobs in S3; pass only S3 keys/URIs in state input.

### 6. Error handling

```json
"Retry": [{
  "ErrorEquals": ["States.TaskFailed", "States.Timeout"],
  "IntervalSeconds": 2,
  "MaxAttempts": 3,
  "BackoffRate": 2.0
}],
"Catch": [{
  "ErrorEquals": ["States.ALL"],
  "Next": "HandleFailure",
  "ResultPath": "$.error"
}]
```

- Map Azure Logic App "run after" failure branches to `Catch` blocks.
- Use **Dead Letter Queues** (SQS DLQ) for tasks that must not be lost.

### 7. Long-running and human tasks

- Durable Functions `waitForExternalEvent` → Step Functions **callback pattern** (`.waitForTaskToken`).
- Human approval flows → `waitForTaskToken` + API Gateway endpoint that calls `SendTaskSuccess` / `SendTaskFailure`.
- Timers → `Wait` state with `Seconds`, `Timestamp`, or `SecondsPath`.

### 8. Observability

- Enable **CloudWatch Logs** on the state machine (ALL or ERROR level).
- Use **X-Ray** tracing for end-to-end visibility.
- Replace Application Insights dependency tracking with structured logging in Lambda tasks.
- Set CloudWatch alarms on `ExecutionsFailed`, `ExecutionsTimedOut`, and `ExecutionThrottled`.

### 9. Security

- Use **IAM roles** per state machine — least privilege for each integration.
- Encrypt state machine definitions and execution history if handling sensitive data.
- For cross-account workflows, use resource-based policies or separate state machines per account.

### 10. Common pitfalls

- Exceeding the **256 KB** execution input/output limit — offload to S3.
- Non-idempotent Lambda tasks combined with retries causing duplicate side effects.
- Using Express workflows for workflows that need exactly-once semantics.
- Forgetting to handle `States.Timeout` in `Catch` blocks.

## RDS Migration Tips

### 1. Engine mapping

| Azure | RDS engine |
|-------|------------|
| Azure SQL Database | RDS for SQL Server |
| Azure Database for PostgreSQL | RDS for PostgreSQL |
| Azure Database for MySQL | RDS for MySQL |
| Azure Database for MariaDB | RDS for MariaDB |

Match major version, collation, and timezone settings before cutover.

### 2. Migration approaches

| Approach | Best for |
|----------|----------|
| **AWS DMS** (Database Migration Service) | Ongoing replication with minimal downtime |
| **Native backup/restore** (`.bak`, `pg_dump`, `mysqldump`) | Smaller DBs or one-time bulk move |
| **RDS snapshot + share/copy** | Same-engine moves already on AWS |

Typical flow: provision RDS → replicate or restore → validate row counts and app queries → cutover DNS/connection string → keep Azure read-only until soak period ends.

### 3. Networking and access from ECS

- Place RDS in **private subnets**; do not assign a public IP in production.
- Security group: allow inbound **only** from the ECS task security group on the DB port (1433, 5432, 3306, etc.).
- Use a **DB subnet group** spanning at least two AZs for Multi-AZ.
- Optional: **RDS Proxy** in front of RDS for connection pooling from many Fargate tasks.

### 4. Credentials and connection strings

- Store host, port, database name, username, and password in **Secrets Manager** (not task env vars in git).
- Reference the secret in the ECS task definition `secrets` block; apps read `DATABASE_URL` or individual vars at startup.
- Rotate credentials with Secrets Manager rotation; update ECS tasks to pick up new values on redeploy.

Example task definition secret reference:

```json
"secrets": [{
  "name": "DATABASE_URL",
  "valueFrom": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789:secret:prod/rds/app:DATABASE_URL::"
}]
```

### 5. Operations checklist

- Enable **automated backups** and set `backup-retention` to match your RPO.
- Turn on **Multi-AZ** for production failover.
- Add **read replicas** if Azure used geo/read scaling (Cosmos-style patterns stay on DynamoDB; standard SQL read scale maps to replicas).
- Monitor with **CloudWatch** (`CPUUtilization`, `FreeStorageSpace`, `DatabaseConnections`) and enable **Enhanced Monitoring** / Performance Insights for slow-query tuning.
- Test failover and restore from snapshot before decommissioning Azure.

### 6. Common pitfalls

- ECS tasks in private subnets with no route to RDS (wrong SG or subnet group).
- Hard-coded Azure connection strings left in container images or Step Functions payloads.
- Engine version or charset mismatch causing silent data truncation after import.
- Undersized storage/IOPS — RDS storage autoscaling helps, but plan baseline IOPS up front.

## Cognito Migration Tips

### 1. What maps where

| Azure | Cognito |
|-------|---------|
| App registration (client ID / secret) | **User pool app client** |
| Tenant ID / authority URL | **User pool ID** + issuer `https://cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/<poolId>` |
| Redirect URIs / logout URLs | App client callback/sign-out URLs |
| API permissions / scopes | **Resource server** + custom scopes (e.g. `api/read`) |
| App roles / group claims | **Cognito groups** (included in ID/access token via `cognito:groups`) |
| Conditional Access / MFA | User pool **MFA**, advanced security, WAF on ALB |
| B2C user flows (sign-up, reset password) | Hosted UI + **Lambda triggers** (`PreSignUp`, `CustomMessage`, etc.) |
| MSAL (`acquireTokenSilent`) | Amplify Auth, `aws-jwt-verify`, or OIDC library against Cognito/OIDC |

**Two patterns:**

- **Replace** — users live in Cognito; migrate passwords via bulk import or reset-on-first-login.
- **Federate** — keep Entra as IdP; Cognito (or ALB/API Gateway) trusts Entra via **SAML/OIDC**. Lower cutover risk for enterprise SSO.

### 2. ECS + ALB (common web app pattern)

Protect an ECS service behind ALB with Cognito **before** traffic hits your containers:

1. Create a **User pool** + app client (authorization code + PKCE for SPAs).
2. Create an **ALB listener rule** with action **Authenticate Cognito** → then forward to target group.
3. ALB sets session cookies; your app receives `X-Amzn-Oidc-*` headers (identity token claims).

Containers can trust ALB-injected headers **only** if traffic cannot bypass the ALB (no direct task IP access).

### 3. API / microservices (JWT validation)

For APIs on ECS, API Gateway, or Lambda:

- Issue **access tokens** (JWT) from Cognito with audience = app client or custom resource-server scope.
- Validate in middleware with **`aws-jwt-verify`** (Node) or equivalent — check `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, and required scopes/groups.
- Do **not** parse JWTs without signature verification; do not trust client-sent user IDs without token validation.

Example env vars on ECS (non-secret):

```json
"environment": [
  { "name": "COGNITO_REGION", "value": "us-east-1" },
  { "name": "COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID", "value": "us-east-1_AbCdEfGhI" },
  { "name": "COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID", "value": "1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j" }
]
```

Store app client **secret** (if used) in Secrets Manager; prefer **public clients + PKCE** for browser/mobile apps.

### 4. User and group migration

| Method | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| **CSV bulk import** | One-time move; passwords must be re-set unless importing hash (limited formats) |
| **Federation to Entra** | Keep Azure passwords/MFA during transition |
| **Just-in-time (JIT)** | `PreAuthentication` / `PostAuthentication` Lambda creates local user on first SSO login |
| **Dual login period** | Entra + Cognito both accepted; deprecate Azure app registration after soak |

Map Azure **security groups / app roles** to Cognito **groups**, then to IAM policies (Identity Pool) or app-level RBAC from `cognito:groups` claims.

### 5. Cognito Identity Pools (optional)

Use when apps need **AWS credentials** in the browser or on device (S3 upload, direct AWS API):

- **User pool** = who the user is (authentication).
- **Identity pool** = temporary AWS creds (authorization to AWS resources).

Map Azure “managed identity for workloads” separately: ECS tasks use **IAM task roles**, not Identity Pools.

### 6. Lambda triggers (B2C parity)

Replace B2C custom policies with User Pool Lambda triggers:

| Trigger | Typical use |
|---------|-------------|
| `PreSignUp` | Auto-confirm, block disposable domains, sync to CRM |
| `PostConfirmation` | Seed RDS profile row, send welcome event to EventBridge |
| `PreTokenGeneration` | Inject custom claims (tenant ID, subscription tier) |
| `CustomMessage` | Branded email/SMS for verification and reset |
| `UserMigration` | Authenticate against legacy Azure DB on first login |

Keep triggers **idempotent** and fast — they run on every sign-in or token issue.

### 7. Step Functions and machine-to-machine

- **Human steps** — user JWT from Cognito; API validates token before starting execution.
- **Service-to-service** — prefer **IAM roles** (ECS task role, Lambda execution role) over embedding Cognito client credentials in state machines.
- If OAuth client credentials are required, store client secret in Secrets Manager and fetch in Lambda at runtime — never in state machine JSON.

### 8. Operations checklist

- Enable **Advanced Security** (compromised credentials, adaptive auth) for production pools.
- Configure **token lifetimes** (access/id/refresh) to match former Azure token policies.
- Set **domain** (Cognito hosted domain or custom domain + ACM cert) before cutover DNS.
- Log auth events to **CloudWatch** (`UserAuthentication`, `ForgotPassword`, etc.) and alarm on anomaly spikes.
- Test sign-up, sign-in, MFA, password reset, token refresh, and **global sign-out** before decommissioning Entra app.

### 9. Common pitfalls

- Redirect URI mismatch (`http` vs `https`, trailing slash) — #1 login failure after migration.
- Validating tokens against wrong **issuer** or **pool ID** after multi-region deploy.
- ALB authenticate action without HTTPS-only listeners — session cookies exposed.
- Putting Cognito **client secrets** in ECS task definitions or Step Functions input.
- Assuming Cognito groups automatically grant IAM access — you must map groups in Identity Pool or enforce RBAC in app code.

## Recommended Migration Order

1. **Inventory** — List Azure resources, dependencies, secrets, and SLAs.
2. **Network** — Stand up VPC, subnets, security groups, endpoints.
3. **Identity** — Stand up Cognito user pool (or Entra federation), app clients, groups; wire ALB authenticate or API JWT validation.
4. **Data** — Migrate databases and blob storage first (often the longest pole).
5. **Containers** — Push images to ECR, create ECS task definitions and services.
6. **Workflows** — Port Logic Apps / Durable Functions to Step Functions state machines.
7. **Cutover** — DNS switch, drain Azure traffic, validate rollback path.
8. **Decommission** — Remove Azure resources after a soak period.
